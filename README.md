# Trafficsignal detection or violation
The System consists of two main components -

Vehicle detection model
A graphical user interface (GUI)
First the video footage from the road side is sent to the system. Vehicles are detected from the footage. Tracking the activity of vehicles, system determines if there is any violation or not. Figure 1 shows how the system works.

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes the system interactive for the user to use. User can monitor the traffic footage and get the alert of violation with the detected bounding box of vehicle. User can take further action using the GUI.
